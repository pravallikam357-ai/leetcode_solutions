# Problem: Kids with greatest no.of candies
# Platform: LeetCode
# Difficulty: Easy
# Topic: Arrays
# Language: Python

#  Problem Description:
# There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

#Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

#Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.
#  Approach:
# Access each element and add with extra candies if it is the highest return true otherwise false.

#  Time Complexity: O(n)
#  Space Complexity: O(n)
